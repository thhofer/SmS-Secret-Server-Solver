# SmS-Secret-Server solver

During the Y-Not-CTF competition, a crypto challenge called SmS Secret Secure Server was offered.

This project looks for the solution to this challenge.

The approach is based on the write-up by duksctf, available at http://duksctf.github.io/YNOT17-SmS-Secret-Server/

This solver is implemented in Kotlin, as an opportunity to learn the language.
